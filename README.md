# Angular 10/9 CookBook

Throughout this cookbook examples you'll learn Angular--one of the most popular platforms for building front-end web applications

Using Angular, you can take advantage of a powerful TypeScript platform and tools to create applications for web, mobile and desktop. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with powerful OOP abstracts and a strongly typed system that compiles to JavaScript.

With Angular you have strong tools and design patterns to build either small or large web projects.

Angular is developed and maintained by Google. It has a large community which means you can find help on the web if you have any issues implementing your project requirements.

Our Angular learning path will offer the necessary tutorials, PDF books, for beginners, and examples to get started using this framework in your next project.

## Introducing Angular 10

[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)  was the most popular client-side framework among JavaScript developers for many years. Google introduced AngularJS in 2012. It's based on a variation of the very popular  [Model-View-Controller pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)  which is called Model-View-*.

The AngularJS framework, was built on top of JavaScript with the aim to decouple the business logic of an application from the low level DOM manipulation and create dynamic websites. Developers could use it to either create full-fledged SPAs and rich web applications or simply control a portion of a web page which makes it suitable for different scenarios and developer requirements.

### Data Binding

Among the powerful concepts that were introduced by AngularJS, is the concept of  [data binding](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding)  which enables the view to get automatically updated whenever the data (the model layer) is changed and inversely.

### Directives

The concept of  [directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)  was also introduced by AngularJS, which allows developers to create their own custom HTML tags.

### Dependency Injection

The other introduced concept is  [Dependency Injection](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di), which allows developers to inject what's called services (singletons that encapsulates a unique and re-usable functionality within an application) into other components which encourages re-usability of the code.

## Why Learning Angular 10?

By learning Angular, you'll have more chances of finding a job as a front-end developer! So in this learning path, will teach you the framework through building several examples from scratch.

You'll learn about:

-   Anglular CLI.
-   Angular components and modules,
-   Angular template syntax and data binding: Interpolation and Event binding,
-   Angular pipes,
-   Angular directives,
-   Angular services,
-   Angular  `HttpClient`,
-   Angular routing,
-   Angular Material,
-   Using Bootstrap with Angular,
-   Deployment.

## How Long Will it Take to Learn Angular 10?

This depends of what you mean by learning Angular. If you want to be able to build and deploy a production-ready Angular application in a reasonable timeframe, this will probably take byou etween 6 and 12 months depending on your background and existing skills.

## Is Angular Easy to Learn?

If you have a good knowledge of the three pillars of the web i.e JavaScript, CSS and HTML, Angular may be easy to learn. If you are a beginner front-end web developer that would be very difficult.

## The Prerequisites to Learn Angular?

You'll need to have a good knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript basics.

A basic Knowledge of TypeScript can be very helpful.

## How Do you Start Learning Angular?

Angular is not like React, it's a complete platform which includes all what you need to build frontend web apps, so learning it will take you more time. Let's make the process easy for you by providing you with a roadmap.

If you are a beginner frontend web developer, you probably want to start by learning the basics of frontend web development i.e what we call the three pillars of the web, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You don't need to master these technologies but you should be familiar with the basics and build simple web pages with HTML, style them with CSS and add interactivity with JavaScript.

You can get started with HTML, JavaScript and CSS from our guides:

-   [HTML Tutorial for Angular developers](https://www.techiediaries.com/html-tutorial/): Angular makes use of regular HTML with an extra template syntax so in this article, we'll introduce you to HTML from an Angular point of vue.
-   [CSS Tutorial for Angular developers](https://www.techiediaries.com/css-tutorial/): We'll also introduce to CSS and we'll see in the same time how you can start using it in the context of Angular.

Angular makes use of TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript. TypeScript is a super-set of JavaScript that adds object oriented concepts and strong types to the language but before you can run your code in a web browser, you will need to compile it to JavaScript. We'll see later that this is pre-configured for you in your Angular project.

These are some JavaScript guides in our website:

And this is our TypeScript tutorial(s):

## What's a Framework and Why Using it

A JavaScript or client-side framework is an abstraction that provides developers with a set of tools to easily and efficiently develop front-end web applications. Most frameworks dictate many aspects of your web projects like directory structure and configuration files and different tools that can be used for adding essential functionalities like testing.

A client-side framework is built on top of a client side programming language to help abstract the low level APIs of programming languages and client APIs and makes developers more productive. In fact there is only one client-side language which is JavaScript; the plethora of the web and the only language that web browsers understand but there also more sophisticated and modern programming languages that compile to JavaScript such as TypeScript and CoffeeScript. Which means they can also be the base of a client side framework.

Frameworks are all the rage nowadays and most serious JS developers use a framework for building front-end apps and interfaces instead of using plain JavaScript or jQuery.

Most JavaScript frameworks are said to be  **opinionated**  which means their creators enforce their opinions or their own philosophy of how web projects should be configured and organized. This also means, developers should learn the new abstractions provided by the framework and any new concepts besides learning the base programming language.

Frameworks provide abstractions for working with many aspects like for example DOM manipulation and Ajax/HTTP. if the technology deals with only one aspect, it's mostly called a library. For example popular libraries like React or Vue.js deal only with the view or the UI of an application by using a virtual DOM and diffing with the real DOM which provides better performance.

Nowadays powerful and modern JavaScript frameworks have emerged and taken the web by storm. Instead of websites with poorly structured JS or jQuery code we have now complete web apps with best practices and code structure with complex and rich UIs. These modern client-side web apps use heavy JavaScript which impacts performance and by result the user experience; and as such even if web browsers became more powerful we still need to follow best practices and battle tested tools and patterns which client-side frameworks try to help with.
